

1. Database Design (SQL)

In the SQL part, I have creating two tables: `Employees` and `Attendance`.

- `Employees`: This table stores information about employees such as their ID, name, and department.
- `Attendance`: This table records the attendance of employees. It includes an attendance ID, employee ID (to associate attendance records with employees), date, and status (whether the employee was present or absent).

Each employee can have multiple attendance records associated with them, recorded by date.

2. Java Application

In the Java application, we're using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to interact with the MySQL database.

- `AttendanceSystem` class: This class establishes a connection to the database and provides a method `markAttendance` to mark the attendance of an employee. It takes an employee ID and status (present/absent) as parameters and inserts a new attendance record into the `Attendance` table.

- `main` method: In the `main` method, an instance of `AttendanceSystem` is created, and then attendance is marked for a sample employee (ID 101) with the status "Present". This is just for demonstration purposes.

### 3. User Interface

The user interface is kept simple with command-line input/output.

- `AttendanceUI` class: This class interacts with the user to mark attendance. It prompts the user to input the employee ID and status (present/absent) and then calls the `markAttendance` method of the `AttendanceSystem` to mark the attendance.

- `main` method: In the `main` method, an instance of `AttendanceUI` is created, and the `markAttendance` method is called to start marking attendance.

Explanation Summary:

- The database design defines the structure of the data storage.
- The Java application connects to the database and provides methods to interact with it.
- The user interface allows users to input data and interact with the application.

Together, these components form a basic employee attendance system where attendance can be marked and stored in a database using Java and SQL.
